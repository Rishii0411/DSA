2026-02-26 | Steps to Reduce Binary Number to 1

	Question
Given binary string s,
return how many steps are needed to reduce it to 1.

	Approach
1.	Key Observation:
	-	If last bit is '0' → number is even → divide by 2
			This is equivalent to removing the last bit.
	-	If last bit is '1' → number is odd → add 1
			This causes binary carry propagation.
2.	Instead of modifying string repeatedly,
	we simulate from right to left using carry.
3.	Maintain:
		carry = 0
		steps = 0
4.	Process bits from rightmost to index 1:
	-	currentBit = (s[i] - '0') + carry
	-	If currentBit == 1:
			Odd → add 1 step (for +1)
			carry = 1
	-	Then divide by 2 → always +1 step
5.	Finally:
	If carry == 1 → one extra step
6.	Time Complexity:
		O(n)
7.	Space Complexity:
		O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int numSteps(string s) {
        int steps = 0;
        int carry = 0;

        for (int i = s.size() - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            int bit = (s[i] - '0') + carry;

            if (bit == 1) {
                steps++;       // add 1
                carry = 1;
            }

            steps++;           // divide by 2
        }

        return steps + carry;
    }
};

	Key Insight
Dividing by 2 removes the last bit.
Adding 1 causes carry propagation.
Tracking carry while scanning from right to left
allows us to simulate operations efficiently
without repeatedly modifying the string.
