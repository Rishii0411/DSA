2025-12-12 | First Non-Repeating Character in Every Prefix

	Question
Given a string s of lowercase alphabets,  
for each index i, find the first non-repeating character in the prefix s[0..i].  
If none exists, use '#'.

	Approach
1.	This is a classic **stream processing** problem.
2.	Maintain:
	-	A frequency array `freq[26]` to count occurrences of characters.
	-	A queue to store characters that are **candidates** for being non-repeating.
3.	Process the string from left to right:
	1.	Increment the frequency of the current character.
	2.	Push the character into the queue.
	3.	While the front of the queue has frequency > 1:
		-	Pop it (it is no longer non-repeating).
4.	After cleanup:
	-	If the queue is empty → append '#'.
	-	Else → append the front character of the queue.
5.	This ensures each character is pushed and popped at most once.
6.	Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1) (since only 26 lowercase letters)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    string firstNonRepeating(string s) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        queue<char> q;
        string result;

        for (char c : s) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
            q.push(c);

            // Remove repeating characters from the front
            while (!q.empty() && freq[q.front() - 'a'] > 1) {
                q.pop();
            }

            if (q.empty())
                result.push_back('#');
            else
                result.push_back(q.front());
        }

        return result;
    }
};
