2025-12-10|Count Smooth Descent Periods in Stock Prices

Question
You are given an integer array prices representing the daily price history of a stock.  
A smooth descent period consists of one or more contiguous days such that prices decrease by exactly 1 each day.  
Return the total number of smooth descent periods.

	Approach
1.	Observation:
	-	Every individual day is a smooth descent period of length 1.
	-	If prices[i] == prices[i-1] - 1, the descent continues.
	-	Otherwise, the descent breaks and a new period starts.
2.	Use a variable `len` to track the length of the current smooth descent ending at index i.
	-	If prices[i] == prices[i-1] - 1 → len = len + 1.
	-	Else → len = 1.
3.	At each index i, add `len` to the answer.
	-	This counts all smooth descent subarrays ending at i.
4.	Initialize len = 1 at the start.
5.	Time complexity: O(n).  
    Space complexity: O(1).

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    long long getDescentPeriods(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        long long ans = 0;
        long long len = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i > 0 && prices[i] == prices[i - 1] - 1) {
                len++;
            } else {
                len = 1;
            }
            ans += len;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
