2025-11-06 | Check If Last Character Is One-Bit

Problem Statement  
You are given a binary array bits.  
Each character is encoded as:
• One-bit character → `0`  
• Two-bit character → `10` or `11`  

The array always ends with a `0`.  
Return true if the last character must be a one-bit character, otherwise return false.

Approach / Explanation  
1. Observation  
We decode the bit stream from left to right:
• If we see a `0`, it represents a one-bit character. Move by 1 step.  
• If we see a `1`, it represents the start of a two-bit character. Move by 2 steps.

2. Key Insight  
We must check whether decoding reaches the last element alone or whether a two-bit character consumes it.

If we end exactly at the final index due to a single-step move → last character is one-bit.  
If we jump past it due to a two-step move → last character is not one-bit.

3. Simple Linear Scan  
Start from index 0 and simulate the decoding process.  
At the end, check if we stopped exactly at the last index.

4. Time Complexity  
• Time: O(n)  
• Space: O(1)

SOLUTION:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isOneBitCharacter(vector<int>& bits) {
        int i = 0;
        int n = bits.size();

        while (i < n - 1) {
            if (bits[i] == 1)
                i += 2;   // two-bit character
            else
                i += 1;   // one-bit character
        }

        // If we stopped exactly at last index, it's a one-bit character
        return i == n - 1;
    }
};
