Question
Given an integer n, return the total amount of money in the Leetcode bank after n days, following Hercy’s saving pattern.

Approach
	1.	Simulate the days of the week
	•	Use an array arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} representing the initial deposits for Monday through Sunday.
	2.	Iterate through each day
	•	Add the current day’s deposit to the total sum.
	•	Increment that day’s deposit by $1 for the next week.
	3.	Cycle through the week
	•	Reset the day index to 0 after Sunday.
	4.	Return the total sum
	•	Continue this simulation until reaching day n.

This approach directly simulates Hercy’s saving schedule and handles weekly increases automatically.

SOLUTION:
class Solution {
public:
    int totalMoney(int n) {
        int arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
        int sum = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while(j < n) {
            sum += arr[i];
            arr[i++]++;
            j++;
            if(i >= 7) i = 0;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
