2025-11-06 | Shortest Common Supersequence Length

Problem Statement
Given two strings s1 and s2, find the length of the shortest string that has both s1 and s2 as subsequences.
A subsequence of a string is formed by deleting zero or more characters without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
Note:
s1 and s2 may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Approach / Explanation
1. Relationship Between LCS and SCS
To form the Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS), we want to merge the two strings in a way that minimizes overlap.
The overlap between s1 and s2 is represented by their Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).

Formula:
\text{Length of SCS} = |s1| + |s2| - \text{Length of LCS}

2. Why This Works
	•	Adding all characters from both strings gives |s1| + |s2|.
	•	But common characters (the LCS) are double-counted, so we subtract their count once.

3. LCS Dynamic Programming Approach
Let dp[i][j] = length of LCS of first i characters of s1 and first j characters of s2.
Recurrence:

if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:
    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]
else:
    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
Base Case:
dp[0][j] = dp[i][0] = 0 (if any string is empty, LCS = 0).
Finally:
LCS = dp[n][m]
SCS = n + m - LCS
4. Time and Space Complexity
	•	Time Complexity: O(n × m)
	•	Space Complexity: O(n × m)
(Can be optimized to O(min(n, m)) using rolling arrays if needed.)

SOLUTION:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int shortestCommonSupersequence(string s1, string s2) {
        int n = s1.size(), m = s2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(m + 1, 0));

        // Compute LCS
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
                if (s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1])
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                else
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }

        int lcs = dp[n][m];
        return n + m - lcs;  // Formula for shortest common supersequence length
    }
};
