Question
Given two linked lists representing two non-negative integers,  
return the head of a linked list representing their sum.

Approach
1.	Since digits are stored in forward order, direct addition is inconvenient.
2.	Reverse both linked lists so we can add digits from least significant to most significant.
3.	Traverse both lists simultaneously:
	-	Add corresponding digits and a carry.
	-	Create a new node with (sum % 10).
	-	Update carry = sum / 10.
4.	If a carry remains after traversal, add a new node for it.
5.	Reverse the resulting list to restore forward order.
6.	Remove any leading zeros from the result.
7.	Time Complexity: O(n + m)  
   Space Complexity: O(1) extra (excluding output list).

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    Node* reverse(Node* head) {
        Node* prev = NULL;
        while (head) {
            Node* nxt = head->next;
            head->next = prev;
            prev = head;
            head = nxt;
        }
        return prev;
    }

    Node* addTwoLists(Node* head1, Node* head2) {
        head1 = reverse(head1);
        head2 = reverse(head2);

        int carry = 0;
        Node* dummy = new Node(0);
        Node* curr = dummy;

        while (head1 || head2 || carry) {
            int sum = carry;
            if (head1) {
                sum += head1->data;
                head1 = head1->next;
            }
            if (head2) {
                sum += head2->data;
                head2 = head2->next;
            }
            carry = sum / 10;
            curr->next = new Node(sum % 10);
            curr = curr->next;
        }

        Node* result = reverse(dummy->next);

        // Remove leading zeros
        while (result && result->data == 0 && result->next) {
            result = result->next;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
