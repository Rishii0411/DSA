2025-12-12 | Find the Intersection Point of Two Linked Lists

Question
You are given the heads of two non-empty singly linked lists that intersect at a certain node.  
Return the node at which the two linked lists intersect.

Approach
1.	Use the **two-pointer technique**.
2.	Initialize two pointers:
	-	p1 starting at head1
	-	p2 starting at head2
3.	Traverse both lists:
	-	Move p1 and p2 one step at a time.
	-	When p1 reaches the end, redirect it to head2.
	-	When p2 reaches the end, redirect it to head1.
4.	Because the lists intersect, both pointers will eventually meet at the intersection node.
5.	This works because:
	-	Both pointers traverse exactly the same total length:
			len(list1) + len(list2)
6.	Time Complexity: O(n + m)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

Solution
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int x) : data(x), next(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    Node* intersectPoint(Node* head1, Node* head2) {
        Node* p1 = head1;
        Node* p2 = head2;

        while (p1 != p2) {
            p1 = (p1 == NULL) ? head2 : p1->next;
            p2 = (p2 == NULL) ? head1 : p2->next;
        }

        return p1; // Intersection node
    }
};
