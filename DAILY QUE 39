2025-10-31 | Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful

Problem Statement
You are given:
	•	A string colors, where colors[i] represents the color of the i-th balloon.
	•	A vector neededTime, where neededTime[i] represents the time needed to remove the i-th balloon.
Return the minimum total time Bob needs to remove balloons so that no two consecutive balloons have the same color.

Constraints:
•	1 <= colors.length == neededTime.length <= 10^5
•	1 <= neededTime[i] <= 10^4
•	colors consists only of lowercase English letters.

Approach / Explanation
	1.	Observation
•	If two or more consecutive balloons share the same color, we must remove all but one of them.
•	To minimize time, keep the one with the maximum removal time (the most expensive to remove) and remove the rest.
	2.	Steps
•	Iterate through colors using two pointers (i, j) to detect groups of consecutive same-colored balloons.
•	For each group:
	•	Compute the total removal time.
	•	Find the maximum removal time in that group.
	•	Add (total - max) to the final answer.
•	Continue until all balloons are processed.
	3.	Time Complexity
•	O(n), since each balloon is visited once.

SOLUTION:
class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(string colors, vector<int>& neededTime) {
        int ans = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int n = colors.length();

        while (i < n) {
            int total = neededTime[i];
            int maxTime = neededTime[i];
            int j = i + 1;

            // Find consecutive balloons of the same color
            while (j < n && colors[j] == colors[i]) {
                total += neededTime[j];
                maxTime = max(maxTime, neededTime[j]);
                j++;
            }

            // If more than one balloon of same color, remove all but one
            ans += (total - maxTime);

            i = j; // Move to next group
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
