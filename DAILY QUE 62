2025-11-06 | Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by 3

Problem Statement  
You are given an integer array `nums`.
In one operation, you may add **1** or subtract **1** from any element.
Return the minimum number of operations needed to make **every** element in `nums` divisible by **3**.

Approach / Explanation  
1. Remainders mod 3  
Every number has one of three remainders when divided by 3:
- If `num % 3 == 0`: already good, cost = 0
- If `num % 3 == 1`:
  To make divisible by 3 → subtract 1  
  cost = 1
- If `num % 3 == 2`:
  To make divisible by 3 → add 1  
  cost = 1

2. Why this works  
To fix remainder:
- Remainder 1 → nearest multiple is (num − 1)
- Remainder 2 → nearest multiple is (num + 1)

Thus, each bad element requires exactly **one** operation.

3. Total operations  
Sum the number of elements not divisible by 3.
4. Time / Space Complexity  
• Time: O(n)  
• Space: O(1)


SOLUTION:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ops = 0;

        for (int x : nums) {
            int r = x % 3;
            if (r == 1 || r == 2) {
                ops += 1;
            }
        }

        return ops;
    }
};
