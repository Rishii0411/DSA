2025-12-08 | Transpose of a Matrix

Question
//paste the provided question here
You are given a square matrix of size n × n.  
Your task is to find the transpose of the given matrix.  
The transpose of a matrix is obtained by converting all rows into columns and all columns into rows.

Approach
1.  Since the matrix is square, transposing can be done in-place.
2.  Loop over all i from 0 to n−1.
3.  For each i, loop over j from i+1 to n−1.
4.  Swap matrix[i][j] with matrix[j][i].
5.  This ensures each pair is swapped exactly once.
6.  Time complexity: O(n²).  
    Space complexity: O(1) extra.

Solution 
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    void transpose(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int n = matrix.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                swap(matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i]);
            }
        }
    }
};
