2025-11-06 | Check if Two Strings are Rotations of Each Other

Problem Statement
Given two strings s1 and s2 of equal lengths, determine if s2 is a rotation of s1.

Definition:
A string s2 is a rotation of s1 if it can be obtained by moving one or more leading characters of s1 to the end (or vice versa), without altering the relative order of characters.

Example:
s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdab" → Rotation
s1 = "abcd", s2 = "acbd" → Not a rotation

Constraints:
•	1 ≤ |s1|, |s2| ≤ 10⁵
•	Strings consist only of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

Approach / Explanation
	1.	Observation
•	If s2 is a rotation of s1, then s1 will always appear as a substring of s2 + s2.
Example:
s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdab"
s2 + s2 = "cdabcdab" → contains "abcd"
	2.	Algorithm
•	Check if s1 and s2 are of equal length — if not, return false.
•	Concatenate s2 with itself.
•	Check whether s1 exists as a substring inside the concatenated string.
	3.	Time Complexity
•	Substring search → O(n) (average case, using built-in string find).
•	Space Complexity → O(n) due to concatenation.

SOLUTION:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
  public:
    bool areRotations(string &s1, string &s2) {
        // If lengths differ, rotation is impossible
        if (s1.size() != s2.size()) return false;

        // Check if s1 exists in s2 concatenated with itself
        return ((s2 + s2).find(s1) != string::npos);
    }
};
