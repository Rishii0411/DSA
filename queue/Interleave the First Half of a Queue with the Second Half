2025-12-12 | Interleave the First Half of a Queue with the Second Half

	Question
Given a queue of even size,  
rearrange it by interleaving its first half with its second half.

	Approach
1.	Let the size of the queue be `n` (n is even).
2.	Use an auxiliary **queue** to store the first half.
3.	Steps:
	1.	Dequeue the first `n/2` elements from the original queue
		and enqueue them into a temporary queue.
	2.	Now, for each element in the temporary queue:
		-	Dequeue one element from the temporary queue and enqueue it back to the original queue.
		-	Dequeue one element from the original queue (from the second half)
			and enqueue it back.
4.	This produces the required interleaving while maintaining order.
5.	Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(n/2)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    void interleaveQueue(queue<int>& q) {
        int n = q.size();
        if (n % 2 != 0) return;  // safety check

        queue<int> firstHalf;

        // Step 1: Move first half to auxiliary queue
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            firstHalf.push(q.front());
            q.pop();
        }

        // Step 2: Interleave the two halves
        while (!firstHalf.empty()) {
            q.push(firstHalf.front());
            firstHalf.pop();

            q.push(q.front());
            q.pop();
        }
    }
};
