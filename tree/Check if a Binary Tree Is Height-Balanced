2026-02-08|Check if a Binary Tree Is Height-Balanced

	Question
Given the root of a binary tree,  
return true if the tree is height-balanced, otherwise return false.

	Approach
1.	Use **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to compute heights bottom-up.
2.	For each node:
	-	Recursively compute the height of the left subtree.
	-	Recursively compute the height of the right subtree.
3.	If at any node:
		|leftHeight − rightHeight| > 1  
	then the tree is **not balanced**.
4.	To optimize:
	-	Return **−1** immediately if an unbalanced subtree is found.
	-	This avoids unnecessary further computation.
5.	If DFS completes without finding imbalance, the tree is balanced.
6.	Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (recursion stack).

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int height(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;

        int leftH = height(root->left);
        if (leftH == -1) return -1;

        int rightH = height(root->right);
        if (rightH == -1) return -1;

        if (abs(leftH - rightH) > 1)
            return -1;

        return max(leftH, rightH) + 1;
    }

    bool isBalanced(TreeNode* root) {
        return height(root) != -1;
    }
};

	Key Insight
Checking balance while computing heights allows early termination.
If any subtree is unbalanced, the entire tree is unbalanced—no need
to traverse further.
