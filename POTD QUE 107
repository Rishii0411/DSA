2025-12-11|Minimum Moves to Seat All Passengers

Question
You are given two arrays chairs[] and passengers[] of equal length.  
You may move a passenger left or right by 1 unit per move.  
Return the minimum total number of moves required so that each passenger is assigned a unique chair.

Approach
1.	Key observation:
	-	This is an **assignment problem on a number line**.
	-	To minimize total movement, we should match passengers to chairs in a way that avoids crossings.
2.	Greedy strategy:
	-	Sort the chairs array.
	-	Sort the passengers array.
	-	Assign the ith passenger to the ith chair after sorting.
3.	Why this works:
	-	Sorting ensures the closest possible matching in order.
	-	Any other pairing would increase total absolute distance.
4.	For each i:
	-	Moves needed = |passengers[i] − chairs[i]|.
	-	Add this to the total.
5.	Time complexity:
	-	Sorting: O(n log n)
	-	Assignment: O(n)
6.	Space complexity:
	-	O(1) extra (ignoring sorting overhead).

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    long long minMovesToSeat(vector<int>& chairs, vector<int>& passengers) {
        sort(chairs.begin(), chairs.end());
        sort(passengers.begin(), passengers.end());

        long long moves = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < chairs.size(); i++) {
            moves += llabs((long long)chairs[i] - passengers[i]);
        }
        return moves;
    }
};
