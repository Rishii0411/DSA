2025-11-06 | Check If All Ones Are K-Distance Apart

Problem Statement  
You are given a binary array nums and an integer k.
Return true if every pair of 1’s in the array is separated by at least k zeros.  
Otherwise, return false.

Approach / Explanation  
1. Observation  
We only care about the distance between consecutive 1’s.  
If the gap between any two 1’s is less than k, we return false.

2. Linear Scan  
Keep track of the index of the previous 1.  
Whenever we find a new 1:
• If it is the first one, record its position.  
• Otherwise, check the distance from the previous 1.  
Distance = currentIndex − previousIndex − 1  
If distance < k → return false.

3. If all checks pass  
Return true.

4. Time Complexity  
• Time Complexity: O(n)  
• Space Complexity: O(1)

SOLUTION:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool kLengthApart(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int prev = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                if (prev != -1 && i - prev - 1 < k) {
                    return false;
                }
                prev = i;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};
