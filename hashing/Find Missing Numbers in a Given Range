	Question
Given arr[] and a range [low, high],
return all numbers in that range
that are missing from the array.

	Approach
1.	Use a hash set for quick lookup.
2.	Insert all elements of arr[] into the set.
3.	Iterate from low to high:
		If number not present in set → add to result.
4.	Since we iterate in increasing order,
	result will already be sorted.
5.	Time Complexity:
		O(n + (high − low + 1))
6.	Space Complexity:
		O(n)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findMissing(vector<int>& arr, int low, int high) {
        unordered_set<int> st(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        vector<int> result;

        for (int num = low; num <= high; num++) {
            if (!st.count(num)) {
                result.push_back(num);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};

	Key Insight
By converting the array into a hash set,
we achieve O(1) lookups and can efficiently
scan the required range to find missing numbers.
