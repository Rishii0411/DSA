2025-12-12 | Kth Element in Two Sorted Arrays

Question
Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[] and an integer k,  
find the element that would be at the kth position in the combined sorted array.

Approach
1.	This is a classic **binary search on partition** problem.
2.	Assume we take `x` elements from array a[] and `k − x` elements from array b[].
3.	We want:
		max(left part) ≤ min(right part)
4.	Binary search on the number of elements taken from the smaller array to ensure efficiency.
5.	Definitions:
	-	leftA  = element just before the cut in a[]
	-	rightA = element just after the cut in a[]
	-	leftB  = element just before the cut in b[]
	-	rightB = element just after the cut in b[]
6.	If leftA ≤ rightB and leftB ≤ rightA:
	-	The kth element is max(leftA, leftB).
7.	Else adjust the binary search range.
8.	Time Complexity: O(log(min(n, m))).  
   Space Complexity: O(1).

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int kthElement(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b, int k) {
        int n = a.size();
        int m = b.size();

        // Ensure a is the smaller array
        if (n > m)
            return kthElement(b, a, k);

        int low = max(0, k - m);
        int high = min(k, n);

        while (low <= high) {
            int cutA = (low + high) / 2;
            int cutB = k - cutA;

            int leftA  = (cutA == 0) ? INT_MIN : a[cutA - 1];
            int leftB  = (cutB == 0) ? INT_MIN : b[cutB - 1];
            int rightA = (cutA == n) ? INT_MAX : a[cutA];
            int rightB = (cutB == m) ? INT_MAX : b[cutB];

            if (leftA <= rightB && leftB <= rightA) {
                return max(leftA, leftB);
            }
            else if (leftA > rightB) {
                high = cutA - 1;
            }
            else {
                low = cutA + 1;
            }
        }

        return -1; // should never reach here
    }
};
