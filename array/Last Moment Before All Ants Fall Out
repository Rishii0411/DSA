2026-02-04|Last Moment Before All Ants Fall Out

	Question
Given n, left[], and right[],  
return the time at which the final ant (or ants) falls off the plank.

	Approach
1.	Key insight:
	-	When two ants collide and reverse direction, it is equivalent to them **passing through each other**.
	-	This means collisions do **not affect the final falling times**.
2.	So we can treat each ant as moving straight to its respective end without interaction.
3.	Time taken:
	-	For an ant at position x moving left → time = x
	-	For an ant at position x moving right → time = n − x
4.	The answer is simply the **maximum** of:
	-	all positions in left[]
	-	all values (n − position) for positions in right[]
5.	This works because all ants move at the same speed.
6.	Time Complexity: O(L + R)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int lastMoment(int n, vector<int>& left, vector<int>& right) {
        int ans = 0;

        // Ants moving left
        for (int x : left) {
            ans = max(ans, x);
        }

        // Ants moving right
        for (int x : right) {
            ans = max(ans, n - x);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
