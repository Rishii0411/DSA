2025-12-12 | Maximum Profit with At Most One Stock Transaction

	Question
Given an array prices[] of non-negative integers,  
find the maximum profit possible with at most one buy and one sell.  
Return 0 if no profit is possible.

	Approach
1.	The idea is to track the **minimum price seen so far** while iterating through the array.
2.	For each day:
	-	Assume you sell on that day.
	-	The profit would be:
			current price − minimum price so far
3.	Update the maximum profit whenever a higher profit is found.
4.	Also update the minimum price whenever a smaller price is encountered.
5.	This ensures:
	-	The buy always happens before the sell.
	-	Only one transaction is considered.
6.	Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int minPrice = INT_MAX;
        int maxProfit = 0;

        for (int price : prices) {
            minPrice = min(minPrice, price);
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
        }

        return maxProfit;
    }
};
