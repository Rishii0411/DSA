Question
Given a sorted array arr[] (0-index based) of distinct integers and an integer k, find the index of k if it is present in arr[].  
If not, return the index where k should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

Approach
1.	Because the array is already sorted, binary search is the most efficient method.
2.	Initialize two pointers:
	-	low = 0
	-	high = n − 1
3.	While low ≤ high:
	-	Compute mid = (low + high) / 2
	-	If arr[mid] == k → return mid
	-	If arr[mid] < k → move right (low = mid + 1)
	-	If arr[mid] > k → move left (high = mid − 1)
4.	If the loop ends without finding k:
	-	low will point to the correct insertion position.
5.	Return low.
6.	Time complexity: O(log n).  
   Space complexity: O(1).

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int searchInsert(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.size() - 1;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] == k)
                return mid;
            else if (arr[mid] < k)
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid - 1;
        }

        return low; // insertion position
    }
};
