2026-02-28 | Pair from Two Sorted Arrays with Sum Closest to x

	Question
Given two sorted arrays and integer x,
return a pair (a, b) such that
|a + b − x| is minimized.

	Approach
1.	Key Observation:
	Since arrays are sorted,
	we can use two-pointer technique.
2.	Initialize:
		i = 0 (start of arr1)
		j = m − 1 (end of arr2)
3.	While i < n and j ≥ 0:
		sum = arr1[i] + arr2[j]
		diff = abs(sum − x)
4.	Update best answer if diff smaller.
5.	If sum > x:
		Decrement j (to reduce sum)
	Else:
		Increment i (to increase sum)
6.	Time Complexity:
		O(n + m)
7.	Space Complexity:
		O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    pair<int, int> closestPair(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2, int x) {
        int n = arr1.size();
        int m = arr2.size();

        int i = 0;
        int j = m - 1;

        int minDiff = INT_MAX;
        pair<int, int> result;

        while (i < n && j >= 0) {
            int sum = arr1[i] + arr2[j];
            int diff = abs(sum - x);

            if (diff < minDiff) {
                minDiff = diff;
                result = {arr1[i], arr2[j]};
            }

            if (sum > x)
                j--;
            else
                i++;
        }

        return result;
    }
};

	Key Insight
Because arrays are sorted,
moving pointers intelligently lets us
explore all relevant pairs in linear time.
This reduces complexity from O(nm)
to O(n + m).
