2026-02-11 | Longest Balanced Subarray (Distinct Evens = Distinct Odds)

	Question
Given nums[], return the length of the longest subarray where
the count of distinct even numbers equals the count of distinct odd numbers.

	Approach
1.	Key observation:
	-	The constraint is on distinct values, not counts.
	-	We must track distinct evens and distinct odds per subarray.
2.	Since distinct tracking depends on the subarray,
	we use a sliding start approach:
3.	For each starting index i:
	-	Use two hash sets:
		-	one for distinct even values
		-	one for distinct odd values
	-	Expand the subarray from i to the right.
	-	Update sets accordingly.
4.	At each extension:
	-	If sizes of both sets are equal,
			update maximum length.
5.	Time Complexity:
	-	O(n²) in worst case
6.	Space Complexity:
	-	O(n) for sets

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int longestBalancedSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            unordered_set<int> evenSet;
            unordered_set<int> oddSet;

            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                if (nums[j] % 2 == 0)
                    evenSet.insert(nums[j]);
                else
                    oddSet.insert(nums[j]);

                if (evenSet.size() == oddSet.size()) {
                    ans = max(ans, j - i + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};

	Key Insight
Since the condition depends on distinct elements inside each subarray,
we must explicitly track them while expanding the window.
Although O(n²), this approach correctly captures distinct parity balance.
