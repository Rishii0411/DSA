	Question
Given arr[] and integer m,
return the minimum possible difference between the maximum and
minimum chocolates among m selected packets.

	Approach
1.	Key Idea:
	-	We must choose m packets.
	-	We want to minimize:
			max(selected) − min(selected)
2.	Optimal strategy:
	-	Sort the array.
	-	After sorting, the best candidates
		will be among consecutive elements.
3.	Why consecutive?
	-	If we pick any non-consecutive group,
	  there exists a tighter consecutive group
	  with smaller difference.
4.	Algorithm:
	1.	Sort arr.
	2.	Slide a window of size m.
	3.	For each window:
			diff = arr[i + m − 1] − arr[i]
	4.	Track minimum diff.
5.	Time Complexity:
	-	O(n log n) (sorting)
6.	Space Complexity:
	-	O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int minDifference(vector<int>& arr, int m) {
        int n = arr.size();
        if (m == 0 || m > n) return 0;

        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        int minDiff = INT_MAX;

        for (int i = 0; i + m - 1 < n; i++) {
            minDiff = min(minDiff, arr[i + m - 1] - arr[i]);
        }

        return minDiff;
    }
};

	Key Insight
After sorting, the best distribution must come from
a consecutive group of size m.
A sliding window gives the optimal solution efficiently.
