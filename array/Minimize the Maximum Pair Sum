2025-12-12 | Minimize the Maximum Pair Sum

	Question
Given an even-length array nums,  
pair up its elements optimally so that the maximum pair sum is minimized,  
and return that minimum possible maximum pair sum.

	Approach
1.	Key greedy insight:
	-	To minimize the largest pair sum, we should **balance large and small values**.
2.	Sort the array in ascending order.
3.	Pair elements as follows:
	-	Smallest element with the largest element,
	-	Second smallest with the second largest,
	-	and so on.
4.	This strategy ensures:
	-	Large numbers are not paired together,
	-	The largest possible pair sum is minimized.
5.	While forming pairs:
	-	Compute the sum of each pair.
	-	Track the maximum among these sums.
6.	Return the maximum sum obtained.
7.	Time Complexity:
	-	O(n log n) due to sorting.
   Space Complexity:
	-	O(1) extra space (excluding sorting).

	Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int minPairSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i]);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
