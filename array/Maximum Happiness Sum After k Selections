2025-12-12 | Maximum Happiness Sum After k Selections

Question
Given an array happiness[] of length n and an integer k,  
Return the maximum total happiness achievable by selecting k children under the described rules.

Approach
1.	Key observation:
	-	Since unselected children lose happiness over time, we should pick children with **higher happiness earlier**.
2.	Greedy strategy:
	-	Sort the happiness array in **descending order**.
3.	Selection logic:
	-	On the i-th selection (0-based):
		-	The effective happiness of the chosen child is:
				max(happiness[i] − i, 0)
		  because their happiness has been reduced by i from previous turns.
4.	Sum up the effective happiness values for the first k children.
5.	Time complexity:
	-	Sorting: O(n log n)
	-	Selection: O(k)
   Space complexity:
	-	O(1) extra (ignoring sorting overhead).

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    long long maximumHappinessSum(vector<int>& happiness, int k) {
        sort(happiness.begin(), happiness.end(), greater<int>());

        long long ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            long long cur = happiness[i] - i;
            if (cur > 0)
                ans += cur;
            else
                break;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
