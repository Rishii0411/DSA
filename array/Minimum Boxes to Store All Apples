2025-12-12 | Minimum Boxes to Store All Apples

Question
Given arrays apple[] (size n) and capacity[] (size m), where apple[i] is the number of apples in pack i and capacity[j] is the capacity of box j, return the minimum number of boxes needed to store all apples.

Approach
1.	Compute the total number of apples:
	-	totalApples = sum of all elements in apple[].
2.	Sort the capacity[] array in **descending order**.
	-	This ensures we always pick the largest available boxes first.
3.	Iterate through the sorted capacities:
	-	Keep adding box capacities until their sum is ≥ totalApples.
	-	Count how many boxes are used.
4.	As soon as the accumulated capacity is sufficient, stop.
5.	Return the count.
6.	This greedy approach is optimal because using larger boxes first minimizes the number of boxes needed.
7.	Time complexity:
	-	Sorting: O(m log m)
	-	Iteration: O(m)
   Space complexity:
	-	O(1) extra (ignoring sorting overhead).

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumBoxes(vector<int>& apple, vector<int>& capacity) {
        long long totalApples = 0;
        for (int a : apple)
            totalApples += a;

        sort(capacity.begin(), capacity.end(), greater<int>());

        long long usedCapacity = 0;
        int boxes = 0;

        for (int cap : capacity) {
            usedCapacity += cap;
            boxes++;
            if (usedCapacity >= totalApples)
                return boxes;
        }

        return boxes; // guaranteed enough capacity per problem statement
    }
};
