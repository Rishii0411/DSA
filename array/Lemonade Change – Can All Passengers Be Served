2025-12-12 | Lemonade Change – Can All Passengers Be Served

	Question
Given an array arr[] where arr[i] represents the note used by the ith passenger (5, 10, or 20),  
determine if all passengers can be served in order while always giving correct change.

	Approach
1.	Maintain counters for available change:
	-	count5 → number of 5-coin notes
	-	count10 → number of 10-coin notes
2.	Process passengers one by one:
	1.	If passenger pays with 5:
		-	No change needed.
		-	Increment count5.
	2.	If passenger pays with 10:
		-	Needs 5 coins as change.
		-	If count5 is zero → return false.
		-	Else decrement count5 and increment count10.
	3.	If passenger pays with 20:
		-	Needs 15 coins as change.
		-	Prefer giving one 10 and one 5 (optimal strategy).
		-	If not possible, try giving three 5s.
		-	If neither option is possible → return false.
3.	If all passengers are served successfully, return true.
4.	Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    bool canServeAll(vector<int>& arr) {
        int count5 = 0, count10 = 0;

        for (int note : arr) {
            if (note == 5) {
                count5++;
            }
            else if (note == 10) {
                if (count5 == 0)
                    return false;
                count5--;
                count10++;
            }
            else { // note == 20
                if (count10 > 0 && count5 > 0) {
                    count10--;
                    count5--;
                }
                else if (count5 >= 3) {
                    count5 -= 3;
                }
                else {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
