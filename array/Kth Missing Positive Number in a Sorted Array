2025-12-12 | Kth Missing Positive Number in a Sorted Array

Question
Given a sorted array of distinct positive integers arr[] and an integer k,  
find the kth positive number that is missing from arr[].

Approach
1.	Key observation:
	-	At index i (0-based), the count of missing numbers **before** arr[i] is:
			missing(i) = arr[i] − (i + 1)
	  because in a perfect array without missing numbers, the value at index i would be i + 1.
2.	We want to find the **smallest index i** such that:
			missing(i) ≥ k
3.	Use **binary search** on indices:
	-	If missing(mid) < k → move right.
	-	Else → move left.
4.	After binary search:
	-	The answer is:
			k + left
	  where `left` is the index where missing(left) ≥ k.
5.	Edge case:
	-	If all missing numbers up to the last element are < k,
	  then the answer lies **after the last array element**.
6.	Time complexity: O(log n).  
   Space complexity: O(1).

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int findKthPositive(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int missing = arr[mid] - (mid + 1);

            if (missing < k)
                left = mid + 1;
            else
                right = mid - 1;
        }

        // kth missing number
        return left + k;
    }
};
