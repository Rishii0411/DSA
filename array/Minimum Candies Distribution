2025-12-12 | Minimum Candies Distribution

	Question
Given an integer array arr[] representing children’s ratings,  
return the minimum number of candies required to distribute according to the rules.

	Approach
1.	Use a **greedy two-pass strategy**, which is optimal and efficient.
2.	Initialize an array candies[] where each child starts with 1 candy.
3.	First pass (left to right):
	-	If arr[i] > arr[i − 1], then:
			candies[i] = candies[i − 1] + 1
	-	This ensures the condition with the left neighbor is satisfied.
4.	Second pass (right to left):
	-	If arr[i] > arr[i + 1], then:
			candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1)
	-	This ensures the condition with the right neighbor is satisfied.
5.	Sum all values in candies[] to get the final answer.
6.	Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(n)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int minCandy(int n, vector<int>& arr) {
        vector<int> candies(n, 1);

        // Left to right pass
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[i - 1]) {
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }

        // Right to left pass
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
            }
        }

        int total = 0;
        for (int c : candies)
            total += c;

        return total;
    }
};
