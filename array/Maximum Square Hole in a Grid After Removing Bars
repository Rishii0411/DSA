2025-12-12 | Maximum Square Hole in a Grid After Removing Bars

	Question
Given integers n, m and arrays hBars and vBars,  
return the maximum area of a square-shaped hole after removing some of the given bars.

	Approach
1.	Key observation:
	-	To form a **square hole of side length L**, you need:
		-	L consecutive unit rows (created by removing L−1 consecutive horizontal bars)
		-	L consecutive unit columns (created by removing L−1 consecutive vertical bars)
2.	Therefore:
	-	We need to find the **longest consecutive sequence** in hBars.
	-	We need to find the **longest consecutive sequence** in vBars.
3.	If the longest consecutive removable bars length is:
	-	kh in horizontal bars,
	-	kv in vertical bars,
	then:
		-	max possible square side = min(kh + 1, kv + 1)
4.	The area of the square is:
			side × side
5.	Steps:
	1.	Sort hBars.
	2.	Find the longest run of consecutive integers in hBars.
	3.	Repeat for vBars.
	4.	Compute the square side and area.
6.	Time Complexity:
	-	Sorting: O(n log n + m log m)
7.	Space Complexity:
	-	O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& bars) {
        if (bars.empty()) return 0;

        sort(bars.begin(), bars.end());
        int longest = 1, curr = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < bars.size(); i++) {
            if (bars[i] == bars[i - 1] + 1) {
                curr++;
            } else {
                curr = 1;
            }
            longest = max(longest, curr);
        }
        return longest;
    }

    int maxSquareHoleArea(int n, int m,
                          vector<int>& hBars,
                          vector<int>& vBars) {
        int maxH = longestConsecutive(hBars);
        int maxV = longestConsecutive(vBars);

        int side = min(maxH + 1, maxV + 1);
        return side * side;
    }
};
