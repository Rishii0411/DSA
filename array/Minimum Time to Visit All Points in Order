2025-12-12 | Minimum Time to Visit All Points in Order

	Question
On a 2D plane, given points[i] = [xi, yi],  
return the minimum time (in seconds) to visit all the points in the given order using the allowed moves.

	Approach
1.	Consider moving from point A = (x1, y1) to point B = (x2, y2).
2.	Let:
	-	dx = |x2 − x1|
	-	dy = |y2 − y1|
3.	In one second, a diagonal move reduces both dx and dy by 1.
4.	The optimal strategy is:
	-	Use as many diagonal moves as possible.
	-	Then finish remaining distance with horizontal or vertical moves.
5.	The minimum time required between two points is:
			max(dx, dy)
6.	Sum this value for all consecutive point pairs.
7.	Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int totalTime = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < points.size(); i++) {
            int dx = abs(points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0]);
            int dy = abs(points[i][1] - points[i - 1][1]);
            totalTime += max(dx, dy);
        }

        return totalTime;
    }
};
