2025-12-11|Minimum Column Deletions to Make Strings Lexicographically Sorted

Question
You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.  
You may delete any set of column indices (applied to all strings).  
After deletion, the strings must be sorted lexicographically.  
Return the minimum number of deleted columns.

Approach
1.	Key idea:
	-	We process columns from left to right.
	-	We want to ensure that for every adjacent pair strs[i] and strs[i+1], the order is not violated.
2.	We maintain an array `sorted[]`:
	-	sorted[i] = true means strs[i] < strs[i+1] is already guaranteed by earlier columns.
3.	For each column j:
	-	Check all adjacent pairs i:
		-	If sorted[i] is false and strs[i][j] > strs[i+1][j],
		  then this column must be deleted (it breaks lexicographic order).
	-	If the column is deleted, increase the answer and move to the next column.
4.	If the column is not deleted:
	-	For every i where strs[i][j] < strs[i+1][j], mark sorted[i] = true,
	  because their order is now permanently fixed.
5.	This greedy approach works because:
	-	Once an order between two strings is fixed, later columns cannot break it.
	-	We only delete a column when it is absolutely necessary.
6.	Time complexity: O(n × m), where:
	-	n = number of strings,
	-	m = length of each string.
   Space complexity: O(n).

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletionSize(vector<string>& strs) {
        int n = strs.size();
        int m = strs[0].size();

        vector<bool> sorted(n - 1, false);
        int deletions = 0;

        for (int col = 0; col < m; col++) {
            bool bad = false;

            // Check if this column violates order
            for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
                if (!sorted[i] && strs[i][col] > strs[i + 1][col]) {
                    bad = true;
                    break;
                }
            }

            // If bad, delete this column
            if (bad) {
                deletions++;
                continue;
            }

            // Otherwise, update sorted relations
            for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
                if (!sorted[i] && strs[i][col] < strs[i + 1][col]) {
                    sorted[i] = true;
                }
            }
        }

        return deletions;
    }
};
