2025-12-12 | Minimum Time to Make n Donuts

Question
Geek is organizing a party and needs n donuts.  
Given m chefs with ranks r[], determine the minimum time required to prepare n donuts.  
Return the minimum time as an integer.

Approach
1.	This is a classic **binary search on time** problem.
2.	Observation:
	-	Minimum time = 0
	-	Maximum time = time taken if the fastest chef makes all donuts alone.
3.	For a given time T:
	-	For each chef with rank r, determine how many donuts they can make within time T.
	-	A chef can make k donuts if:
			r × k × (k + 1) / 2 ≤ T
	-	We can find k using a simple loop or binary search (since k is small).
4.	Sum donuts made by all chefs.
	-	If total ≥ n → T is feasible.
	-	Else → T is too small.
5.	Binary search to find the minimum feasible T.
6.	Time Complexity:
	-	Binary search: O(log answer)
	-	Per check: O(m × sqrt(T))
7.	Space Complexity:
	-	O(1)

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    bool canMake(int n, vector<int>& rank, long long time) {
        long long donuts = 0;

        for (int r : rank) {
            long long t = 0;
            long long k = 1;

            while (true) {
                t += r * k;
                if (t > time) break;
                donuts++;
                if (donuts >= n) return true;
                k++;
            }
        }
        return donuts >= n;
    }

    int minTime(int n, vector<int>& rank) {
        int m = rank.size();

        long long low = 0;
        long long high = (long long)*min_element(rank.begin(), rank.end()) 
                         * n * (n + 1) / 2;

        long long ans = high;

        while (low <= high) {
            long long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (canMake(n, rank, mid)) {
                ans = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return (int)ans;
    }
};
