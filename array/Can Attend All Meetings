2026-02-16 | Can Attend All Meetings

	Question
Given meeting intervals arr[][],
return true if a person can attend all meetings,
otherwise return false.

	Approach
1.	Key idea:
	-	If any two meetings overlap,
	  then it is impossible to attend both.
2.	Sort the meetings by their starting time.
3.	Traverse the sorted intervals:
	-	For each meeting i:
		If arr[i][0] < arr[i−1][1]
			→ Overlap exists → return false
4.	If no overlap found, return true.
5.	Time Complexity:
	-	O(n log n) due to sorting
6.	Space Complexity:
	-	O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    bool canAttendMeetings(vector<vector<int>>& arr) {
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (arr[i][0] < arr[i - 1][1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
};

	Key Insight
After sorting by start time,
any overlap can be detected by comparing
each meeting with the previous one.
If no overlaps exist, all meetings can be attended.
