2026-02-24 | Sum of Root-to-Leaf Binary Numbers

	Question
Given the root of a binary tree,
return the total sum of all binary numbers
formed from root to leaf paths.

	Approach
1.	Use Depth-First Search (DFS).
2.	At each node:
		Update current value:
			curr = (curr << 1) | node->val
3.	If the node is a leaf:
		Add curr to total sum.
4.	Otherwise:
		Recurse for left and right child.
5.	Time Complexity:
		O(n)
6.	Space Complexity:
		O(h) recursion stack (h = tree height)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(TreeNode* root, int curr) {
        if (!root) return 0;

        curr = (curr << 1) | root->val;

        if (!root->left && !root->right)
            return curr;

        return dfs(root->left, curr) + dfs(root->right, curr);
    }

    int sumRootToLeaf(TreeNode* root) {
        return dfs(root, 0);
    }
};

	Key Insight
Instead of constructing binary strings,
we build the number directly using bit shifting:
	curr = curr * 2 + node->val
This makes the solution efficient and clean.
