2026-02-18 | Check if Number Has Alternating Bits

	Question
Given integer n,
return true if its binary representation
has alternating bits, otherwise return false.

	Approach
1.	Observation:
	If bits alternate,
	then:
		n XOR (n >> 1)
	will produce a number consisting of all 1s.
2.	Why?
	-	Shifting n right aligns adjacent bits.
	-	XOR of alternating bits always gives 1.
3.	So let:
		x = n ^ (n >> 1)
4.	If x is of form 111...111,
	then:
		x & (x + 1) == 0
5.	Time Complexity:
	-	O(1)
6.	Space Complexity:
	-	O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    bool hasAlternatingBits(int n) {
        int x = n ^ (n >> 1);
        return (x & (x + 1)) == 0;
    }
};

	Key Insight
For alternating bits,
XORing the number with itself shifted right
produces a sequence of all 1s.
Checking whether a number is all 1s
can be done efficiently using:
	x & (x + 1) == 0.
