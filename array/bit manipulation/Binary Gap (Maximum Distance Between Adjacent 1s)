2026-02-22 | Binary Gap (Maximum Distance Between Adjacent 1s)

	Question
Given integer n,
return the maximum distance between two adjacent 1s
in its binary representation.
If fewer than two 1s exist, return 0.

	Approach
1.	Traverse bits from right to left.
2.	Keep:
		lastPosition = index of last seen '1'
		currentPosition = current bit index
3.	Whenever we see a 1:
		If lastPosition != -1:
			update maxDistance
		Update lastPosition
4.	Shift n right each step.
5.	Time Complexity:
		O(log n)
6.	Space Complexity:
		O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int binaryGap(int n) {
        int lastPos = -1;
        int currPos = 0;
        int maxDist = 0;

        while (n > 0) {
            if (n & 1) {
                if (lastPos != -1)
                    maxDist = max(maxDist, currPos - lastPos);
                lastPos = currPos;
            }
            n >>= 1;
            currPos++;
        }

        return maxDist;
    }
};

	Key Insight
We only need to track positions of 1s.
Each time we encounter a new 1,
compare it with the previous one
and update the maximum distance.
