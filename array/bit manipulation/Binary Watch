	Question
Given turnedOn,
return all valid times that can be represented
with exactly turnedOn LEDs ON.

	Approach
1.	Observation:
	-	Valid hours range: 0 to 11
	-	Valid minutes range: 0 to 59
2.	Brute-force all valid times:
	For hour from 0 to 11:
		For minute from 0 to 59:
			Count number of set bits in:
				hour + minute
			If total set bits == turnedOn:
				add formatted time
3.	Use builtin bit-count function:
		__builtin_popcount()
4.	Time Complexity:
	-	12 × 60 = 720 → constant time
5.	Space Complexity:
	-	O(1) excluding output

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> readBinaryWatch(int turnedOn) {
        vector<string> result;

        for (int hour = 0; hour < 12; hour++) {
            for (int minute = 0; minute < 60; minute++) {
                int bits = __builtin_popcount(hour) + 
                           __builtin_popcount(minute);

                if (bits == turnedOn) {
                    string time = to_string(hour) + ":";
                    if (minute < 10)
                        time += "0";
                    time += to_string(minute);

                    result.push_back(time);
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};

	Key Insight
The total number of possible times is small (720),
so brute-force with bit counting is both simple
and fully optimized.
