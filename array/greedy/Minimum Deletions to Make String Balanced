2026-02-03|Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced

	Question
Given a string s of only `'a'` and `'b'`,  
return the minimum number of deletions required to make s balanced.

	Approach
1.	Key insight:
	-	A violation occurs when a `'b'` appears before an `'a'`.
	-	To fix this, we must delete either:
		-	The `'b'` before, or
		-	The `'a'` after.
2.	Greedy strategy:
	-	Traverse the string from left to right.
	-	Keep track of:
		-	`countB`: number of `'b'` characters seen so far.
		-	`deletions`: minimum deletions needed up to the current index.
3.	For each character:
	-	If it is `'b'`:
		-	Increment `countB`.
	-	If it is `'a'`:
		-	This creates a conflict with all previous `'b'`s.
		-	We have two choices:
			1.	Delete this `'a'` → deletions + 1
			2.	Delete all previous `'b'`s → countB
		-	Choose the minimum of these two options.
4.	Update deletions accordingly.
5.	The final value of `deletions` is the answer.
6.	Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDeletions(string s) {
        int countB = 0;
        int deletions = 0;

        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == 'b') {
                countB++;
            } else { // c == 'a'
                deletions = min(deletions + 1, countB);
            }
        }

        return deletions;
    }
};
