2025-12-12 | Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s (Dutch National Flag)

	Question
Given an array arr[] containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s,  
sort the array in ascending order without using built-in sort.

	Approach
1.	Use the **Dutch National Flag algorithm**.
2.	Maintain three pointers:
	-	low → position where next 0 should go
	-	mid → current element being examined
	-	high → position where next 2 should go
3.	Initialize:
	-	low = 0
	-	mid = 0
	-	high = n − 1
4.	Process elements while mid ≤ high:
	-	If arr[mid] == 0:
		-	Swap arr[low] and arr[mid]
		-	Increment low and mid
	-	If arr[mid] == 1:
		-	Just increment mid
	-	If arr[mid] == 2:
		-	Swap arr[mid] and arr[high]
		-	Decrement high
		-	Do NOT increment mid (the swapped value needs re-checking)
5.	After completion, array is sorted.
6.	Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    void sort012(vector<int>& arr) {
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = arr.size() - 1;

        while (mid <= high) {
            if (arr[mid] == 0) {
                swap(arr[low], arr[mid]);
                low++;
                mid++;
            } 
            else if (arr[mid] == 1) {
                mid++;
            } 
            else { // arr[mid] == 2
                swap(arr[mid], arr[high]);
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
};
