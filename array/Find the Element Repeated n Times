2025-12-12 | Find the Element Repeated n Times

	Question
Given an integer array nums of length 2n containing n + 1 unique elements,  
where exactly one element appears n times, return that element.

	Approach
1.	Key observation:
	-	Since one element appears n times and others only once,
	  the repeated element must appear **very frequently**.
2.	We can solve this efficiently using a hash set:
	-	Traverse the array.
	-	If an element is already present in the set, it must be the repeated one.
3.	Return the first element found twice.
4.	Time Complexity: O(n).  
   Space Complexity: O(n).

	Alternative Insight (Constant Space):
•	In many cases, checking adjacent elements or elements with small gaps also works,
  but using a hash set is the most straightforward and reliable approach.

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int repeatedNTimes(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> seen;
        for (int x : nums) {
            if (seen.count(x))
                return x;
            seen.insert(x);
        }
        return -1; // guaranteed not to reach here
    }
};
