2025-12-12 | Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix

Question
Given an m × n matrix grid sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise,  
return the number of negative numbers in grid.

Approach
1.	Key observation:
	-	If grid[i][j] is negative, then **all elements to the right of it in the same row are also negative**.
2.	Start from the **top-right corner** of the matrix.
3.	Use a two-pointer traversal:
	-	If the current value is negative:
		-	All elements below it in that column are also negative.
		-	Add (m − row) to the count.
		-	Move one column to the left.
	-	If the current value is non-negative:
		-	Move one row down.
4.	Continue until you go out of bounds.
5.	Time Complexity:
	-	O(m + n) — each row and column is visited at most once.
   Space Complexity:
	-	O(1) extra space.

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int countNegatives(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();

        int row = 0, col = n - 1;
        int count = 0;

        while (row < m && col >= 0) {
            if (grid[row][col] < 0) {
                count += (m - row);
                col--;
            } else {
                row++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
