2025-12-11|First Row with Maximum Number of 1s

Question
You are given a 2D binary array arr[][] of size n × m.  
Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.  
Return the index of the first row that contains the maximum number of 1s.  
If no row contains a 1, return -1.

Approach
1.	Key observation:
	-	Since each row is sorted, all the 1s appear **after the last 0**.
2.	For each row:
	-	Use binary search to find the index of the **first 1**.
	-	Number of 1s in that row = m − firstOneIndex.
3.	Track:
	-	maxOnes → maximum number of 1s seen so far.
	-	ansRow → index of the row with maxOnes.
4.	If a row has more 1s than maxOnes:
	-	Update maxOnes and ansRow.
5.	Because we iterate rows in increasing index order, the first row with maximum 1s is automatically selected.
6.	Time complexity:
	-	Binary search per row → O(log m)
	-	Total → O(n log m)
   Space complexity:
	-	O(1) extra space.

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int rowWithMax1s(vector<vector<int>>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int m = arr[0].size();

        int maxOnes = 0;
        int ansRow = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Find first 1 using binary search
            int low = 0, high = m - 1;
            int firstOne = m;

            while (low <= high) {
                int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
                if (arr[i][mid] == 1) {
                    firstOne = mid;
                    high = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
            }

            int onesCount = m - firstOne;
            if (onesCount > maxOnes) {
                maxOnes = onesCount;
                ansRow = i;
            }
        }

        return ansRow;
    }
};
