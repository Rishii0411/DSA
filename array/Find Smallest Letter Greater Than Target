2025-12-12 | Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target

	Question
Given a sorted array of characters `letters` and a character `target`,  
return the smallest character in `letters` that is lexicographically greater than `target`.  
If none exists, return the first character in `letters`.

	Approach
1.	This is a classic **binary search** problem.
2.	Because the array is sorted:
	-	We can efficiently search for the first character greater than `target`.
3.	Use binary search:
	-	Initialize `left = 0`, `right = letters.size() - 1`.
	-	While `left <= right`:
		-	Compute `mid`.
		-	If `letters[mid] <= target`:
			-	Search the right half.
		-	Else:
			-	Search the left half.
4.	After binary search:
	-	If `left` is within bounds, `letters[left]` is the answer.
	-	Otherwise, wrap around and return `letters[0]`.
5.	Time Complexity: O(log n)  
   Space Complexity: O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    char nextGreatestLetter(vector<char>& letters, char target) {
        int left = 0, right = letters.size() - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (letters[mid] <= target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        // If no letter greater than target, wrap around
        if (left == letters.size())
            return letters[0];

        return letters[left];
    }
};
