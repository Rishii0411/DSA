2025-12-12 | Minimize Difference Between Highest and Lowest of k Scores

	Question
Given an array nums and an integer k,  
return the minimum possible difference between the highest and lowest scores among any k selected students.

	Approach
1.	If k is 1:
	-	The difference is always 0, since only one score is selected.
2.	Sort the array nums in ascending order.
3.	After sorting, the best group of k students must appear as a **contiguous subarray** of size k.
4.	Use a **sliding window** of size k:
	-	For each window starting at index i:
			diff = nums[i + k − 1] − nums[i]
5.	Track the minimum difference across all such windows.
6.	Time Complexity:
	-	O(n log n) due to sorting.
7.	Space Complexity:
	-	O(1) extra space (excluding sorting).

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDifference(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if (k <= 1) return 0;

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int n = nums.size();
        int ans = INT_MAX;

        for (int i = 0; i + k - 1 < n; i++) {
            ans = min(ans, nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i]);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
