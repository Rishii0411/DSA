2025-12-11|Minimum Column Deletions to Make Each String Sorted

Question
You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.  
You may choose deletion indices, and delete those characters from every string.  
Return the minimum number of deletions such that every resulting string is lexicographically sorted.

Approach
1.	Iterate column by column from left to right.
2.	For each column j:
	-	Check all rows i.
	-	If for any row:
			strs[i][j] < strs[i][j − 1]
	  then column j **must be deleted** because it breaks the sorted order of that row.
3.	Count such columns.
4.	This greedy approach works because:
	-	Each column is independent.
	-	If a column violates sorted order in any row, keeping it is invalid.
5.	Time complexity: O(n × m), where:
	-	n = number of strings,
	-	m = length of each string.
   Space complexity: O(1).

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int minDeletionSize(vector<string>& strs) {
        int n = strs.size();
        int m = strs[0].size();
        int deletions = 0;

        for (int col = 1; col < m; col++) {
            for (int row = 0; row < n; row++) {
                if (strs[row][col] < strs[row][col - 1]) {
                    deletions++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return deletions;
    }
};
