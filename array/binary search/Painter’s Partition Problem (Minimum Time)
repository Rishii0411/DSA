2026-02-14 | Painter’s Partition Problem (Minimum Time)

This is essentially about splitting the array into k contiguous parts
such that the maximum sum among those parts is minimized.

	Question
Given arr[] and k painters,
return the minimum time needed to paint all boards.

	Approach
1.	Key Observation:
	-	If we assume a time limit T,
	  we can check if k painters are enough
	  such that no painter paints more than T total length.
	-	This forms a monotonic condition.
2.	Search Space:
	-	Minimum time = max(arr[i])
	-	Maximum time = sum(arr[i])
3.	Binary Search:
	-	Mid = candidate maximum time per painter.
	-	Check feasibility:
		-	Greedy assign boards to painters.
		-	If current painter exceeds mid,
			assign new painter.
	-	If painters used ≤ k:
			try smaller time.
	-	Else:
			increase time.
4.	Time Complexity:
	-	O(n log(sum(arr)))
5.	Space Complexity:
	-	O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPossible(vector<int>& arr, int k, long long maxTime) {
        long long currSum = 0;
        int painters = 1;

        for (int length : arr) {
            if (currSum + length <= maxTime) {
                currSum += length;
            } else {
                painters++;
                currSum = length;
                if (painters > k)
                    return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    long long minTime(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        long long low = *max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        long long high = 0;

        for (int x : arr)
            high += x;

        long long ans = high;

        while (low <= high) {
            long long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (isPossible(arr, k, mid)) {
                ans = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
};

	Key Insight
This problem reduces to minimizing the maximum subarray sum
when partitioning into k contiguous parts.
Binary search on answer combined with greedy validation
gives the most optimized solution.
