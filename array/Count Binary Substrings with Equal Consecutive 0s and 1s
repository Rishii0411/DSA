2026-02-19 | Count Binary Substrings with Equal Consecutive 0s and 1s

	Question
Given binary string s,
return the number of non-empty substrings
that contain equal consecutive groups of 0s and 1s.

	Approach
1.	Key Observation:
	-	The substring must consist of exactly two consecutive groups:
			(zeros followed by ones) OR (ones followed by zeros)
	-	If we track lengths of consecutive groups,
	  the number of valid substrings between two adjacent groups
	  is:
			min(length_of_prev_group, length_of_current_group)
2.	Algorithm:
	1.	Traverse the string and compute lengths of consecutive groups.
	2.	Keep track of:
			prevGroupLength
			currGroupLength
	3.	Whenever character changes:
			Add min(prevGroupLength, currGroupLength) to answer.
			Update prevGroupLength = currGroupLength.
			Reset currGroupLength = 1.
	4.	After loop, add final min(prev, curr).
3.	Time Complexity:
		O(n)
4.	Space Complexity:
		O(1)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    int countBinarySubstrings(string s) {
        int prevGroup = 0;
        int currGroup = 1;
        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == s[i - 1]) {
                currGroup++;
            } else {
                result += min(prevGroup, currGroup);
                prevGroup = currGroup;
                currGroup = 1;
            }
        }

        result += min(prevGroup, currGroup);
        return result;
    }
};

	Key Insight
Valid substrings only occur between two consecutive groups
of 0s and 1s.
Counting group lengths and summing the minimum of adjacent groups
gives a clean O(n) solution.
