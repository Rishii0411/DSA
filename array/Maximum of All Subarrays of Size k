2025-12-12 | Maximum of All Subarrays of Size k

	Question
Given an array arr[] of positive integers and an integer k,  
find the maximum value for each contiguous subarray of size k and return them as an array.

	Approach
1.	Use a **Deque (double-ended queue)** to store indices of array elements.
2.	The deque will always store indices in such a way that:
	-	Elements are in **decreasing order of values** from front to back.
3.	For each index i:
	1.	Remove indices from the front that are **out of the current window** (i − k).
	2.	Remove indices from the back whose corresponding values are **smaller than arr[i]**
		because they can never be the maximum for future windows.
	3.	Add the current index to the back of the deque.
4.	Once i ≥ k − 1:
	-	The element at the front of the deque is the **maximum** of the current window.
5.	Repeat until all elements are processed.
6.	Time Complexity: O(n)  
   Space Complexity: O(k)

	Solution

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> maxOfSubarrays(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<int> result;
        deque<int> dq; // stores indices

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Remove elements out of this window
            if (!dq.empty() && dq.front() == i - k)
                dq.pop_front();

            // Remove smaller elements from the back
            while (!dq.empty() && arr[dq.back()] <= arr[i])
                dq.pop_back();

            dq.push_back(i);

            // Window of size k formed
            if (i >= k - 1)
                result.push_back(arr[dq.front()]);
        }

        return result;
    }
};
