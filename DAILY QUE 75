2025-12-06 | Count Valid Partitions with Max–Min ≤ k

Question
•   paste the question provided here
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. Your task is to partition nums into one or more non-empty contiguous segments such that in each segment, the difference between its maximum and minimum elements is at most k.
Return the total number of ways to partition nums under this condition.
Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Approach
1.  Let n = nums.size().
    Define dp[i] = number of valid ways to partition prefix nums[0..i–1] (i.e., first i elements).
    dp[0] = 1 (empty prefix has exactly one way).
2.  For each i from 1 to n, we want to extend backwards and consider all possible segment starts j (0 ≤ j < i):
    A segment nums[j..i–1] is valid iff:
        max(nums[j..i–1]) – min(nums[j..i–1]) ≤ k.
    If valid, add dp[j] to dp[i].
3.  Maintain sliding-window max and min using monotonic deques while expanding the segment backward.
    When extending j → j–1, update deques and check validity. Stop early when max–min exceeds k because extending the window further only increases range.
4.  Time complexity: O(n) amortized because each index enters/deletes from deques once.
    For each right bound i, left bound j moves only forward globally.
5.  Answer is dp[n].

    Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int countPartitions(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        const int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        multiset<int> sl;
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> f(n + 1, 0), g(n + 1, 0);
        f[0] = 1;
        g[0] = 1;
        int l = 1;
        for (int r = 1; r <= n; ++r) {
            int x = nums[r - 1];
            sl.insert(x);
            while (*sl.rbegin() - *sl.begin() > k) {
                sl.erase(sl.find(nums[l - 1]));
                ++l;
            }
            f[r] = (g[r - 1] - (l >= 2 ? g[l - 2] : 0) + mod) % mod;
            g[r] = (g[r - 1] + f[r]) % mod;
        }
        return f[n];
    }
};
