Question
Given a square matrix mat[][], swap the elements of the major diagonal with the elements of the minor diagonal.  
Major diagonal: i == j  
Minor diagonal: i + j == n − 1

Approach
1.	Let n be the size of the matrix.
2.	Loop through each row index i from 0 to n − 1.
3.	For each row i:
	- Major diagonal element is at mat[i][i].
	- Minor diagonal element is at mat[i][n − 1 − i].
4.	Swap these two elements.
5.	Do this for all rows.  
6.	Time complexity is O(n) since we only traverse the diagonals once.  
   Space complexity is O(1) because the swap is done in-place.

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    void swapDiagonals(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int n = mat.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            swap(mat[i][i], mat[i][n - 1 - i]);
        }
    }
};
