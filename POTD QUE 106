Question
Given an array arr[] of positive integers.  
Sort it such that the first part of the array contains odd numbers sorted in descending order, and the remaining part contains even numbers sorted in ascending order.

Approach
1.	Iterate through the array and separate elements into two temporary arrays:
	-	odd → all odd numbers.
	-	even → all even numbers.
2.	Sort the odd array in descending order.
3.	Sort the even array in ascending order.
4.	Overwrite the original array:
	-	First place all elements from the sorted odd array.
	-	Then place all elements from the sorted even array.
5.	Time Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting.  
   Space Complexity: O(n) for auxiliary arrays.

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    void sortOddEven(vector<int>& arr) {
        vector<int> odd, even;

        for (int x : arr) {
            if (x % 2 == 1)
                odd.push_back(x);
            else
                even.push_back(x);
        }

        sort(odd.begin(), odd.end(), greater<int>());
        sort(even.begin(), even.end());

        int idx = 0;
        for (int x : odd)
            arr[idx++] = x;
        for (int x : even)
            arr[idx++] = x;
    }
};
