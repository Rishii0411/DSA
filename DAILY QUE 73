Question
•	paste the question provided here
•	There are n cars on an infinitely long road. The cars are numbered from 0 to n - 1 from left to right and each car is present at a unique point.
•	You are given a 0-indexed string directions of length n. directions[i] can be either ‘L’, ‘R’, or ‘S’ denoting whether the ith car is moving towards the left, towards the right, or staying at its current point respectively. Each moving car has the same speed.
•	The number of collisions can be calculated as follows:
•	When two cars moving in opposite directions collide with each other, the number of collisions increases by 2.
•	When a moving car collides with a stationary car, the number of collisions increases by 1.
•	After a collision, the cars involved can no longer move and will stay at the point where they collided. Other than that, cars cannot change their state or direction of motion.
•	Return the total number of collisions that will happen on the road.

Approach
1.	Observation:

•	Any leading sequence of ‘L’ cars (leftmost cars that move left) will never meet anyone to their left, so they never collide.
•	Any trailing sequence of ‘R’ cars (rightmost cars that move right) will never meet anyone to their right, so they never collide.
•	All cars that remain after removing those leading ‘L’s and trailing ‘R’s will eventually become stationary due to collisions. Each such moving car contributes exactly one to the count of “cars that must stop” — and when two moving cars meet head-on they add 2 collisions, which is captured by counting both moving cars.

2.	Algorithm:

•	Scan from the left to skip initial ‘L’ characters (they never collide).
•	Scan from the right to skip trailing ‘R’ characters (they never collide).
•	In the substring that remains (if any), every character that is not ‘S’ (i.e., ‘L’ or ‘R’) will eventually participate in collisions. The total number of collisions equals the count of those non-‘S’ characters.

3.	Complexity:

•	Time: O(n) — single pass to find bounds and one pass to count.
•	Space: O(1) extra space.

Solution
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
class Solution {
public:
    long long countCollisions(string directions) {
        int n = directions.size();
        int l = 0, r = n - 1;

        // skip leading 'L's (they move left off to infinity)
        while (l < n && directions[l] == 'L') l++;

        // skip trailing 'R's (they move right off to infinity)
        while (r >= 0 && directions[r] == 'R') r--;

        long long collisions = 0;
        for (int i = l; i <= r; ++i) {
            if (directions[i] == 'L' || directions[i] == 'R')
                collisions++;
        }
        return collisions;
    }
};
