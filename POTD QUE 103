2025-12-11|Check if One String Is a Rotation of Another

Question
You are given two strings s1 and s2, of equal lengths.  
Check if s2 is a rotated version of s1.

Approach
1.	If the lengths of s1 and s2 are not equal, s2 cannot be a rotation of s1 → return false.
2.	Concatenate s1 with itself to form a new string temp = s1 + s1.
3.	If s2 is a rotation of s1, then s2 must appear as a substring of temp.
4.	Use string search (find) to check whether s2 exists in temp.
5.	Time complexity: O(n).  
   Space complexity: O(n).

Solution
class Solution {
public:
    bool isRotation(string s1, string s2) {
        if (s1.length() != s2.length())
            return false;

        string temp = s1 + s1;
        return temp.find(s2) != string::npos;
    }
};
