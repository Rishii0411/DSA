2025-11-06 | First Prime Number Greater Than N

Problem Statement  
You are given an integer n.  
Find and return the first prime number strictly greater than n.


Approach / Explanation  
1. Observation  
A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.  
To find the next prime:
• Start from n + 1  
• Check if the number is prime using a primality test  
• If prime, return it  
• Otherwise, continue checking the next number

2. Checking for Primality  
To check if a number x is prime:
• If x < 2 → not prime  
• Try dividing x by all integers from 2 to √x  
• If any divisor exists → not prime  
• Otherwise → prime

3. Looping Until Prime Found  
Start from n + 1 and test each number until a prime is found.  
This guarantees correctness because prime numbers are infinite.

4. Time Complexity  
Primality check: O(√x)  
Worst-case overall: O(k√x), where k is the number of candidates checked (usually small)

SOLUTION:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPrime(long long x) {
        if (x < 2) return false;
        for (long long i = 2; i * i <= x; i++) {
            if (x % i == 0)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    int nextPrime(int n) {
        long long x = n + 1;
        while (!isPrime(x)) {
            x++;
        }
        return x;
    }
};
