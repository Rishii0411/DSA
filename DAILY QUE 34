2025-10-29 | Smallest Number with All Set Bits ≥ n

Question

Return the smallest integer x ≥ n such that all bits of x are 1.

Approach
	1.	Observe that numbers with all set bits are of the form
So we need to find the smallest k such that:
2^k - 1 
	3.	Start with x = 1 and keep doubling (x = (x << 1) | 1) until x >= n.

SOLUTION:
class Solution {
public:
    long long smallestAllBitsSet(long long n) {
        long long x = 1;
        while (x < n) {
            x = (x << 1) | 1;  // shift left and set all bits
        }
        return x;
    }
};
