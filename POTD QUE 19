Question

Given a queue q containing integer elements, your task is to reverse the queue.

Approach
	1.	Use a Stack
	•	Dequeue all elements from the queue and push them onto a stack.
	•	Since a stack reverses the order of insertion, the top will contain the last dequeued element.
	2.	Reinsert into Queue
	•	Pop all elements from the stack and enqueue them back into the queue.
	•	This restores the queue in reversed order.


SOLUTION:
class Solution {
  public:
    void reverseQueue(queue<int> &q) {
        stack<int> st;

        // Step 1: Move all elements from queue to stack
        while(!q.empty()) {
            st.push(q.front());
            q.pop();
        }

        // Step 2: Push all elements back from stack to queue
        while(!st.empty()) {
            q.push(st.top());
            st.pop();
        }
    }
};
