2025-11-06 | Tiling a 2 × N Floor

Problem Statement
Given a floor of dimensions 2 × n and tiles of size 2 × 1, find the number of ways to completely cover the floor using these tiles.

Note:
Since the number of ways can be large, you may take the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 (if needed).

Approach / Explanation
	1.	Observation
• Let f(n) represent the number of ways to tile a 2×n floor.
• For the last column(s), two possibilities exist:
	1.	Place one vertical tile → the remaining space is 2×(n−1), contributing f(n−1) ways.
	2.	Place two horizontal tiles (stacked) → the remaining space is 2×(n−2), contributing f(n−2) ways.
• Therefore,
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
This is identical to the Fibonacci sequence.
	2.	Base Cases

	•	f(1) = 1 → only one vertical tile fits.
	•	f(2) = 2 → two ways: two vertical tiles or two horizontal tiles.

	3.	Algorithm
• Use either recursion with memoization or bottom-up dynamic programming.
• For large n, iterative DP is preferred for efficiency.
	4.	Time and Space Complexity
• Time Complexity: O(n)
• Space Complexity: O(1) (if we store only the last two results).

SOLUTION:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int countWays(int n) {
        const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

        if (n == 1) return 1;
        if (n == 2) return 2;

        long long prev2 = 1; // f(n-2)
        long long prev1 = 2; // f(n-1)
        long long curr = 0;

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            curr = (prev1 + prev2) % MOD;
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = curr;
        }

        return (int)curr;
    }
};
